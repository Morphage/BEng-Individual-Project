\chapter{Introduction}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

\section{Motivation}


\begin{itemize}
\item The rise in MOOCs such as Coursera, Udacity shows that there is a real interest in learning programming.
\item Programming is considered "difficult'' to learn and it can only be learnt effectively through lots and lots of practice. Hence, the need to provide a platform for students to practice their programming skills and understanding of programming concepts.
\item Having a lecturer come up with all the exercises by himself can be both time consuming and ineffective: some exercises may not be challenging enough for certain top students, or on the contrary too difficult for struggling students, which can be discouraging.
\item Lecturers can only rely on a few homework assignments to get an idea of how students are doing. Having a way for lecturers to gather large amounts of data about students' performances would be beneficial. Allows for supplementary material, exercises, etc...
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
Having identified the core problem, this leads to formulating objectives in order to make the project successful and useful to the parties involved. \newline

The main objective of this project is to produce a web-based teaching infrastructure to complement the introductory first year programming classes. Four key features were identified in order to make the project successful:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Programming questions/exercises -} The web platform should allow students to practice their programming skills and understanding of programming concepts. Additionally, it should be possible for a tutor or lecturer to add questions.
\item \textbf{Progress tracking -} A tool to allow appropriate people, such as lecturers, tutors, etc... to view the students results, providing them with useful statistics of students and class performance.
\item \textbf{Adaptive difficulty -} The questions or exercises presented to the students should be suited to their ability. Not only will this stimulate learning, but it will also give a better indication of a student's understanding of the programming concepts being tested.
\item \textbf{Automated generation -} There should 
Allow for some degree of automated generation of exercises. There should be some mechanism blabla so as to keep an infinite supply of ``fresh" questions, so that students don't end up answering the same questions and memorizing their answers.
\end{itemize}

While investigating existing solutions (Section 2.2 - Related Work) we found out that "web questions" and progress tracking were available in most, whereas adaptive difficulty and especially automated generation weren't as present.

%-----------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we start off by giving an overview of the theoretical fundamentals which will be used in . Finally, we conclude with a tour of existing solutions.

\section{Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)}
Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), also called \textit{tailored testing}, is a form of computer-based test that adapts to the examinee's ability.
\begin{itemize}
\item Students can be presented with questions/exercises that are either too easy or too difficult.
\item CAT is a solution to this problem as it automatically chooses the exercises of the appropriate difficulty level for the students.
\item Based on IRT for item selection
\item Evaluation of CAT
\end{itemize}

\section{Item Response Theory (IRT)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculates the probability of a particular student answering a specific question correctly.
\item Different IRT models: One-Parameter Logistic (1-PL), Two-Parameter Logistic (2-PL), Three-Parameter Logistic (3-PL). Refers to the number of parameters used in the model. Parameters are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] question difficulty parameter (\textit{b})
\item[-] question discrimination parameter (\textit{a})
\item[-] chance/guessing paramter (\textit{c})
\end{itemize}

\item Item Characteristic Curve, i.e. probability distribution

\end{itemize}


\section{Related Work}
A lot of tools and research in this area, particularly in making environments suitable to teach programming to students. However, automatic exercise generation in these tools is usually non-existent or very limited.
\subsection{ELP}
Environment for Learning to Program (ELP) is an interactive web based environment for teaching programming to first year Information Technology students at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

\chapter{Project Plan}
\section{Current Progress}
At the moment, most of the work that I've done on the project has involved researching techniques for adapting the difficulty level of questions and the automated generation of exercises. Through the research that I have done, I have understood the techniques to adapt the difficulty level of questions to suit the student's ability and I feel that the implementation of this aspect should go smoothly. On the other hand, the research of automated exercise generation hasn't shown great results, thus the plan is to implement a very basic amount of automated exercise generation and to leave more advanced methods of automated generation as an extension.
\newline

In addition, I have advanced on the details of the implementation, the architecture of the system, as well as the technologies I will be using to complete the project. The application I will develop will be a Java applet embedded in a website. SQL will be used for all database related aspects of the project, for instance, the question bank, student profiles, etc... will be recorded in a database. \newline

I have therefore programmed a basic Java applet to help with getting started.

\section{Plan}

\textbf{Extensions -} The realization of these features is dependent on time and whether I can find enough research material which allows me to achieve their implementation. They are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Better automated generation of exercises
\item Add support for Haskell and C
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system has correctly modelled the ability of the student
\item The system is useful in helping students to learn programming and helping lecturers with feedback of their teaching, in the form of statistics.
\end{itemize}
