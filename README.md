jSCAPE (Java Self-assessment Center of Adaptive Programming Exercises)
=======================

jSCAPE was a product of my final year project for the BEng Computing degree. jSCAPE is a web application, which allows students to practice their understanding of programming concepts through various exercises, while recording their progress in the form of statistical data. 

The diffculty of exercises is adapted to the students' ability and these can be generated automatically. As part of the project I also wrote a custom Java server and database code. Technologies used in this project include JavaFX, JDBC, SQL, Javascript InfoVis Toolkit, CSS and Git.

The final report/thesis for the project can be found at \jSCAPE\Report\final.pdf.
