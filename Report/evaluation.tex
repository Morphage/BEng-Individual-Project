\label{chap:evaluation}
Mention how our developed system performs against the advantages and disadvantages of CAT.

The evaluation stage will address mostly these two aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system has correctly modelled the ability of students
\item The system is useful in helping students to learn programming and helping lecturers with getting feedback on their teaching, in the form of statistics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Qualitative}
\begin{itemize}
\item Surveys to get feedback from students on interface, usability, etc...
\item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Quantitative}
\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical analysis to evaluate item calibration and modelling of student's abilities
\item 
\end{itemize}

evaluate the fact that teachers have to enter the parameters of items.

show IRT run as evaluation of implementation of IRT

evaluate exercises used .... Research\cite{Lister} has shown that a code snippet and an exercise asking for the behaviour of the code, provides effective assessment on a student's understanding of code semantics.
