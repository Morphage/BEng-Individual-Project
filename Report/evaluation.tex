Mention how our developed system performs against the advantages and disadvantages of CAT.

The evaluation stage will address mostly these two aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system has correctly modelled the ability of students
\item The system is useful in helping students to learn programming and helping lecturers with getting feedback on their teaching, in the form of statistics.
\end{itemize}
