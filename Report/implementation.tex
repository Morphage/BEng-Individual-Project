\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}
Talk about design choices such as only multiple choices, no exercises asking to write code, writing custom server, etc...

Mention three tier architecture

implemented as a JavaFx applet

list tools+technology and evaluate advantages/disadvantages

java programming exercises

server implementation, message codes, objectin/out streams, serverthread


CAT development, we refer back to the five components of a CAT...what item selection algorithm we use, what scoring procedure, no termination criterion, entry point is average knowledge distribution initially and attempts at a calibrated item pool, currently with teacher providing the parameters since obtaining a high quality calibrated item pool isn't something I can do.

\begin{lstlisting}
/**
 * Calculates the item information for the provisional proficiency level
 * estimated until that moment, i.e. thetaEstimate.
 */
 private double itemInformation(int thetaEstimate, Item item) {
     double information;

     double a = item.getA();
     double c = item.getC();

     double aSquared = Math.pow(a, 2);
     double p = probabilityCorrectAnswer(thetaEstimate, item);
     double q = 1 - p;

     information = aSquared * (q / p);

     double numerator = p - c;
     double denominator = 1 - c;

     information = information * Math.pow(numerator / denominator, 2);

     return information;
}
